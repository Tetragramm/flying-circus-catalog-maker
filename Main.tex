    After the end, helping communities get in touch with those around them and restoring trade was one of the most important things.  Into the gap stepped the Baron, with the Bergziegel design.  This innovative transport could move people and large cargos as far as it's escorts could keep it safe.

    One of the cheapest large transports you'll ever find, this steady, reliable plane has traveled the skies of Himmilgard for more than 15 years.

    The pinnacle of Macchi shipbuilding, the Republic-class was by all
    measures the most advanced ship in the world. Macchi's battleships
    existed primarily to deter any other power from pursuing control of the
    seas. Though feared, these expensive ships were only rarely deployed
    because of the risk of being sunk by aircraft, though they completely
    dominated any engagement they joined. Some of those that survived
    offshore have become fortified towns.

              1, or 2 Thaler for each Dependent. If you pay 0, erase one mark. If you pay 2, mark their
              track and describe what special thing you do for them to make their lives easier.

              A Dependent at 2 Marks removes 1 Stress per routine. A Dependent losing a Mark gives
              1 Stress, and at 0 Marks they cause 2 Stress per routine.

              as they have XP for from one another, instead of just 1. Other playbook moves cost 1 less
              XP to learn, and this character can teach any move they’ve learned.
