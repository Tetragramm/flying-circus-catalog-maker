    After the end, helping communities get in touch with those around them and restoring trade was one of the most important things.  Into the gap stepped the Baron, with the Bergziegel design.  This innovative transport could move people and large cargos as far as it's escorts could keep it safe.

    One of the cheapest large transports you'll ever find, this steady, reliable plane has traveled the skies of Himmilgard for more than 15 years.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The external nacelle engine mounts can be modified to use nearly any type of engine, or even asymmetric engines while still being stable and easy to fly.
        \item Add extra fuel to travel long-distances.
        \item Trade cargo space for up to 15 additional passengers
        \item An extended fuselage can allow even huge cargos to be carried.

    The pinnacle of Macchi shipbuilding, the Republic-class was by all
    measures the most advanced ship in the world. Macchi's battleships
    existed primarily to deter any other power from pursuing control of the
    seas. Though feared, these expensive ships were only rarely deployed
    because of the risk of being sunk by aircraft, though they completely
    dominated any engagement they joined. Some of those that survived
    offshore have become fortified towns.
